# Optimizely Add Ons Library 

This library houses all of Optimizelyâ€™s Add On components. Add Ons allow you to build on-top and extend Optimizely. Currently, we support Extensions and Custom Integrations.

Please contact developers@optimizely.com if you have any questions.

## Extensions

Extensions are reusable templates for making changes in the visual editor. View the [documentation](https://developers.optimizely.com/x/extensions/) or our code samples in the [Extension Library](https://github.com/optimizely/extension-library/tree/master/Extensions). 

## Custom Integrations

Custom integrations allow customers to create project level integrations that can be enabled/disabled for individual campaigns. Today, we support analytic integrations to extend Optimizely to your third party analytic tools. View our supported integrations in the [Integration Library](https://github.com/optimizely/extension-library/tree/master/Integrations/Analytics).
