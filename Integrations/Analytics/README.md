## Analytic Integrations

Analytics integrations allow customers to track Optimizely experiments in an external analytics tool. With the flip of a switch, Optimizely can append experiment data to  tracking code, so customers can see the impact of their experiments in their analytics tool.

## Adding an Integration

To create a new custom extension, go to Implementation > Extensions > Create New > Create New Integration Extension. Once you create the integration, you'll land in the Integration Builder. In the right panel, there is a code editor, with a few tabs. In each of these tabs, you can write code that will run at a different point in the campaign lifecycle.
